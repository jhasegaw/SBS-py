# SBS-py

This is a working directory for experiments in python/waf scripting of kaldi tools.
Right now it's a clone of Hao's bash-based working directory; nothing original here yet.

Usage:
```
git clone https://www.git.com/kaldi-asr/kaldi
cd kaldi/egs
git clone https://www.git.com/jhasegaw/SBS-py
```
